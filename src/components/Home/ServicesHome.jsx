            Our aim of crafting a sustainable and smarter future is achievable
            through numerous services that utilise Nature Based Assets such as
            wind, solar, and anaerobic digestion. For instance, renewable energy
            technologies including those powered by wind turbines, solar panels
            and anaerobic digestion are becoming increasingly cost-effective
            forms of energy generation. Furthermore, hydrogen vehicles are
            proving to be a viable and cleaner alternative form of
            transportation for the public.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Nature Based Assets such as these give us the ability to tackle
            climate change and reduce dependence on carbon-based energy
            resources. Therefore it is essential that we capitalise on Nature
            Based Assets along with other innovative services in order to move
            towards a sustainable future.
