            To realize our mission of supporting millions of smallholder
            farmers, we are looking for partners to join forces. Collaborating
            with GEP as a project coordinator is as straightforward as we can
            make it. We're here to help you and the farmers in the community you
            serve, after all. Here's how it works: <br />
            Get in touch with one of our account managers; they'll explain next
            steps and expectations <br />
            Gather information and fill out the required paperwork in our online
            portal; weâ€™re committed to customer due diligence and will provide
            any support you need
            <br />
            Serve as lynchpin between GEP and local smallholder farmers, both to
            direct revenue streams and to facilitate communication <br />
            Pay out farmers (at least 75% of the proceeds of CRU sales) and
            watch as your local community flourishes, from farm to family to
            neighborhood <br />
            Submit annual progress reports and assist us in keeping our data and
            models up to date through reporting and monitoring{" "}
