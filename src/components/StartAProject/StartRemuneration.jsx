            Most of the carbon credit sales revenue flows back to you and the
            farmers you represent. We take a fixed 20% to cover our costs. As
            project coordinator, you're entitled to up to 5-10% as well. The
            remaining 70-75 % is paid out to farmers, at least once a year. How
            much a CRU sells for depends on supply and demand, but we'll always
            charge a minimum of â‚¬20, to minimize financial risk for the farmers.
