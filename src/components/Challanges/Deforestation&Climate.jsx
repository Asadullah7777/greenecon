                present serious challenges to the planet. While deforestation
                leads to loss of biodiversity and affects efforts to reach net
                zero carbon emissions, Climate Change has numerous repercussions
                including extreme weather events, rising sea levels and coral
                bleaching. To meet these challenges, we need to switch to
                sustainable practices that reduce deforestation and limit global
                warming.

                Solutions range from planting more trees and using renewable
                energy sources such as solar, hydroelectricity and wind power.
                We need to work together to address deforestation and Climate
                Change in order to protect our environment for future
                generations.
